# social-network

## Description
API for a social network at a social media startup company that uses a NoSQL database, enabling the website to handle large amounts of unstructured data.

Invoking the application in the command line starts the server and the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database.

Opening the API GET routes in Insomnia for users and thoughts displays the data for each of these routes in formatted JSON.

Testing the API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia allows the user to successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts in my database.  

Testing the API POST and DELETE routes in Insomnia enables the user to successfully create and delete reactions to thoughts and add and remove friends to a userâ€™s friend list.
